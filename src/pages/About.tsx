                <p>
                  <span className="text-brand">FlavorTrail</span> was born from a simple observation: too many people feel intimidated by cooking, 
                  despite having a natural curiosity about food. Traditional recipe apps dump overwhelming 
                  ingredient lists and complex instructions, leaving home cooks feeling defeated before they even start.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We believed there had to be a better way. What if learning to cook could feel like playing a game? 
                  What if cultural food exploration could happen naturally, through gentle prompts and bite-sized lessons? 
                  What if building culinary confidence could be as engaging as completing daily language lessons?
                </p>
                <p>
                  That's how <span className="text-brand">FlavorTrail</span> was born - as the "Duolingo for cooking" that helps you discover flavors, 
                  cultures, and techniques through curiosity-driven exploration rather than rigid instruction.
