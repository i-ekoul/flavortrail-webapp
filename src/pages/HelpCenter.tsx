                    FlavorTrail is a web application that helps you develop an intuitive relationship with food through 
                    gamified learning, daily challenges, and bite-sized culinary wisdom. Instead of overwhelming recipe 
                    lists, we focus on building your cooking confidence through curiosity-driven prompts, flavor quests, 
                    and progressive skill development. Our goal is to make cooking accessible, fun, and adventurous for 
                    home cooks everywhere, regardless of experience level.
